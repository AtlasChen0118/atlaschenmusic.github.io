I conducted an undergraduate research project with teammates on the on-line paintability of multipartite graphs, studying a setting of vertex-coloring games under dynamic adversary constraints. We explored optimal strategies when a graph is revealed sequentially. Through the project, we proposed an on-line scenario where optimal solution strategies could be found on extremizing the number of colors used in vertex coloring of certain characteristic graphs, where for each color a particular adverse constraint was given on a subset of vertices.

### GitHub Repositories
- **Noises Suitable for Weighted SVM**  
  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AtlasChen0118/Noises-Suitable-For-Weighted-SVM)

<p style="margin-top: 0.75em; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;">
This is a light-weighted Machine Learning based project that measures and classifies on-campus traffic noise I proposed under the cross-supervision of Prof. Derek Hoiem (CS 441 - Applied Machine Learning) and Prof. Carlos Ramírez (MUS 414 - Urban Soundscapes), where noise is recorded, processed and served as training material for a weighted SVM model that distinguish areas with continuous traffic on street with areas with frequent pull-overs. This work showcases my proficiency with Python, JupyterNotebook and specifically the librosa package.

- **Grid Singer: A SuperCollider-Based Video Game**  
  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AtlasChen0118/Grid-Singer-A-SuperCollider-based-video-game)

<p style="margin-top: 0.75em; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;">
Grid Singer is a 500-line SuperCollider-based video game project for the course Creative Audio Coding I inspired by the vintage game *Jetpack Joyride*, but where you shout into the microphone instead of holding the screen for character levitation. The louder you shout, the faster you ascend. Due to the nature of SuperCollider, it is not possible to embed the game directly on the website. Please click the embedded link above to my GitHub page for more information and code.

### Performances

- **Croatian Rhapsody (Calculator Performance)**

<p style="margin-top: 0.75em; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;">
This is a piece of calculator performance I have performed and published on Bilibili in 2022, a showcase of my resilience and creativity in an academic environment I have been in that banned musical instruments. It accumulated over half a million views throughout the years.

### Music
- **Music Composition: W.H.A.T.?! (Whimsical Happy Afternoon Teatime?!)**  
<p style="margin-top: 0.75em; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;">
This is a light-hearted electronic track featuring playful melodies with crisp rhythmic textures I produced in 2024 with FL Studio. This track started as a 3-hour composition challenge in the UIUC Electronic Music Club, later extended into a full track.

- **Music Composition: Elegy to Mourn Victims in Trials To**  
<p style="margin-top: 0.75em; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;">
This is a piece I produced as a project for a Music Theory and Practice course, exploring the notion of blending a classical melancholic Locrian pressing scale to a modern format setting with ample third inversion major seventh chords. It end up being a somber musical reflection resembling loss and remembrance.
